# Movie Trailer Website

This project generates a movie website from a provided data structure of favourite movies.


## Quickstart

To run this program, Python 3 must be installed. The latest version of Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/).

In the command line, navigate to the folder containing `entertainment_center.py` and type:
```
python entertainment_center.py
```

## To Collaborate

To add more movies to the page, open `entertainment_center.py` and add:

```
your_movie_name = media.Movie('Movie Title', '''Plot summary.''',
'http://movie-poster-url', 'http://link-to-trailer-on-youtube')
```

Where each of the above is replaced with the relevant movie data.

Remember to also add `your_movie_name` to the list below this:
```
movies = [guardians, star_wars, doctor_strange, 
          school_of_rock, princess_bride, iron_giant, your_movie_name]
```

## Contributions
